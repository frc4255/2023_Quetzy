## Sensors & Electronics

We use two REV Throughbore encoders to track the absolute position of the arm and wrist. For Field-Relative swerve drive, autonomous path following, and auto balancing, we use a NavX gyro. Quetzy is run entirely with Falcon 500s and their integrated encoders, no pneumatics are used on the robot. We used REV Blinkin LED drivers to control the color and pattern of our LEDs.
